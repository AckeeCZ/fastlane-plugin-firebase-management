[![fastlane Plugin Badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/fastlane/fastlane/master/fastlane/assets/plugin-badge.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-firebase)

## Getting Started

This project is a [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-firebase`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin firebase_management
```

## About firebase_management

An unofficial tool to access Firebase project settings. It allows you to create new apps and download config files (GoogleInfo.plist for ios and google-services.json for android).

Plugin uses new official Firebase Management API introduced on Firebase Summit 10/2018. It's based on [tkohout/fastlane-firebase-plugin](https://github.com/tkohout/fastlane-firebase-plugin), which uses web scraping instead of official API to manage Firebase apps.

**This very first version was developed using alpha version of the API in a very short time, so it's not well tested and may contain bugs or mistakes. Issues and PRs are very welcome! ðŸ¤—**
